  <body><div id="forena-1" frx:block="forena_help/design_topics"><p>All forena reports are stored as regular files in your reports directory, so they can be edited directly using the text editor of your choice.&nbsp; The contents of these reports can also be edited using our provided editor.&nbsp; Once you navigate to a specific report, the following editing tabs are made available:&nbsp;</p><h2>Data</h2><p>Specify the data you want to include in your report.&nbsp; Data blocks are typically provided by developers or site administrators.&nbsp; Each data block corresponds to a specific query to a database or application.&nbsp; To add data to an existing report, specify the Data Block and a Template and choose Preview.&nbsp;</p><p>If the Data Block requires parameters you'll be prompted for them in the Parameters field set.&nbsp;</p><p>You may optionally specify a where or order by clause to be used with this database query.</p><p>Keep pressing Preview until you see the data that you're expecting in the report below.&nbsp; Don't worry if the preview shows too many fields, or isn't quite in the right format.&nbsp; You'll be able to control that in the Layout tab later.</p><p>If you need to remove a data section from the report, you can check the checkboxes next to the Data Block that is currently being displayed and press save.</p><h2>Fields</h2><p>In the fields tab, specify fomatting options for how you want each Field to display when it is used in the report.&nbsp; You should see a separate field set for each&nbsp; Field found in the report.&nbsp; There are no required data elements here, but an explanation of the options are as follows;</p><p>Format - Indicates which custom data format is used to format the data (e.g. drupal_date or iso_date).&nbsp;</p><p>Format String - Used to indicate the method in the format string.&nbsp; The value here totally depends on the Format indicated (e.g. Y-m-d)</p><p>Link - Specify a site relatie URL.&nbsp; When specified, all references to this field in the report will be displayed as a links to the URL specified.</p><p>Target - Specify the target of the</p><p>Default Value - The value to display when no value is present in the data.</p><h2>Layout</h2><p>In the layout tab, you can edit the body of the report, save the report as another, and control which document exports are available. &nbsp;Explanation of the opions on this form are as follows:&nbsp;</p><p>Report Name - &nbsp;This is the machine readable name associated with the report, changing the name of an exisitng report invokes a save as function, so you are in effect making a copy of the report.&nbsp;</p><p>Category - This controls under which group the report appears under the My Reports link.</p><p>Form - The form determines the look and feel of the report. &nbsp;In conventional report writers this can be thought of as what kinid of paper form the report printed on. &nbsp;In the modern days of the web most layout is controlled by Cascacding Style Sheets (CSS). &nbsp;Specify the form of the report and any css or js files of the same name in your reports directory will automatically get added to the report. &nbsp;In this way you can establish common styles that get used by reports that have the same form name. &nbsp;If you leave this blank, the default form, specified in the Forena configuration menu is used.&nbsp;</p><p>Hidden - Checking this box will cause the report not to be listed in the My Reports list regardless of the Category set.&nbsp;</p><p>Document Options - You can specify which document export formats are enabled for each report. &nbsp;For each document format checked, a link is enabled on the report to an export of the document in that format. &nbsp;For example, you might allow a report to be exported in .csv, .xls or in printable html view.&nbsp;</p><h2>Params</h2><p>The params or parameters tab is used to control how report parameters are prompted. &nbsp;Here you can specify configuration of each parameter that is used in the report.&nbsp;</p><p>Id - This is the internal id of the parameter. &nbsp;Please don't change this unless you know what you're doing as this must match the parameters found int he data blocks used by the report.&nbsp;</p><p>label - Indicates the title or label used to prompt for this parameter.&nbsp;</p><p>default value - The value to use for this paramter if none is specified.&nbsp;</p><p>description- A discription indicateing more information about how to fill in the parameter</p><p>data source - Indicates the block that will be used for validating this input. &nbsp;The block should return key value pairs to be used in select or validation lists.</p><p>data field - The filed that indicates which lookup values will be used to populate the paramter when a data source is specified.</p><p>control - What type of control is used to prompt the user.</p><p>remove this parameter - check this to remove the paramter from a form that is no longer needed. &nbsp;</p><p/><ul><li id="forena-2" frx:foreach="*">{title}</li></ul></div></body>

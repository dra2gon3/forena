<body><h2>Overview</h2><p>Forena is a report writing tool that is designed to help developers who are knowledgeable in writing SQL. &nbsp;It helps you write reports quickly and separates data from SQL effectively. &nbsp; It is designed to leverage the power of SQL. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Report definitions are stored as files on the file system in .frx files. &nbsp;These files are basically extended XHTML template files. &nbsp; Report authors need only to learn a few special attributes and tags (e.g. frx:block frx:foreach) to create reports in virtually any layout. &nbsp;Frx report files are typically stored in a location writable by the web user, so that they can be authored using a WYSIWYG report editor. &nbsp;Report definitions can typically be modified by a group of power users. &nbsp;These users do not need to know SQL, but should be comfortable in html/css.&nbsp;</p><p>Data are typically accessed through "data blocks" which are basically references to parameterized sql files. The .sql data blocks are stored on the file system, typically in a location that is not writable by the web user.&nbsp;</p><p>This guide documents how to install, &nbsp;configure and maintain forena as well as how to leverage the power of other drupal modules to enhance Forena's capabilities.&nbsp;</p><ul id="forena-1" frx:block="forena_help/admin_topics"><li id="forena-2" frx:foreach="*"><span>{title}</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p></body></html>
